Guides = SEO articles (topical clusters, intent: informational → soft CTA to /remote-kits).  
Remote Kits = single sales landing (/remote-kits) with samples, free prompts, testimonials, 2 pricing tiers.  
Tools = 3rd-party affiliate directory (single page /tools) — preview only on homepage.

Move current homepage to /tools.  
Create new homepage with these locked sections:

1) Hero (2-col): Left = Headline + Subheadline + CTA "Mulai dengan Remote Kits"; Right = promo banner image (use /mnt/data/Screenshot 2025-11-22 at 23.35.35.png). No search, no slider.  
2) Featured Remote Kits: 4 small product cards in a 4-grid (CTA → /remote-kits).  
3) Guides (dominant): category chips (clusters), 1 featured guide, 4–6 guide cards, CTA → /guides. Guides are SEO-first articles.  
4) Tools preview: 6 compact tool cards pulled from existing data, CTA → /tools.  
5) Footer: reuse existing footer and include "Submit as Author" CTA link to /about.

Use existing components/styles only. Do not add libraries. Ensure routes: /, /tools, /guides, /guides/[slug], /remote-kits, /about.
